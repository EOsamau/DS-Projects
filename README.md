Data Set Mortgage:
The data set mortgage is in panel form and reports origination and performance observations for 50,000 residential U.S. mortgage borrowers over 60 periods. 
The periods have been identified. As in the real world, loans may originate before the start of the observation period 
(this is an issue where loans are transferred between banks and investors as in securitization). 
The loan observations may thus be censored as the loans mature or borrowers refinance.
